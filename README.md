# Skin-Cancer-Detection-
This project helps detect melanoma, a type of skin cancer, using computer technology. Instead of checking skin cancer manually, which takes time and may not be accurate, we use a deep learning model called ResNet-50.  The system uses images of skin lesions to find out if they are cancerous (malignant) or not (benign).
